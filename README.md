üë©‚Äçüéì **Some experiments and drills done during my data fullstack training**

 üêç All the code you'll find here is written in Python 3.10, and most of the files are in Jupyter Notebooks format. 
 It's mainly based on pedagogical interest. For this reason, some bits of code cannot be transposed as they stand to a real-life situation.
